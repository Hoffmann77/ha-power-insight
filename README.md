# PowerInsight

A custom component for Home Assistant that provides you interesting insights about the electrical Power in your home.

You can add multiple PV-Systems and Energy storages to get insights about the current and total savings these devices generate for you.

In addition you can add electrical consumers to get detailed insights about the current and total costs and the sources of energy.

By using power instead of energy this component also works with dynamic electricity prices.

See below for a full list of the sensors provided by this component.

FAQ:

How are the savings calculated:
We consider two ways The devices can generate savings. The first way is accomplished by selling surplus energy to the grid.
The second way is accomplished by replacing energy that would need to be imported from the grid with energy generated by your devices.
To get the savings we add the savings generated by selling to the grid (export compensation) and the savings generated by replacing grid energy (self consumption savings) and subtract the costs the devices accumulate. For PV-Systems this is mainly the standby consumption during nights. For Energy storages this is the consumption associated with the charging of the device.

Why does my Battery have negative savings.
First of all all devices can have negative savings if they don't generate enough money to cover the costs. This can also be the case for batteries. Nevertheless energy storages always have negative savings when charging. We track the costs of the energy storage during charging.



## Sensors

## PV-Systems:
- Export power: The amount of excess power this device is currently returning to the grid.
- Export share: The devices share of power returned to the grid.

- self consumption power: The amount of power generated by this device that is used reduce the import from the electrical grid

self consumption share: The share of 

- self consumption savings: The current savings in generated by replacing grid imports with the self consumption power generated by this device.
